I am writing a markdown knowledge system to publish as a github repo. It centers on learning web development, mostly with vanilla HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS stack. There's a page or an article for every concept, technology, tool, implementation detail or area of application. With multiple links to other ones. So help me by writing an article about the concept and reality of the Web itself for the page that opens when user clicks on the word "web" at any page.
