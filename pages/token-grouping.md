# Token Grouping

Tokens can be grouped and organized in various ways to form more complex expressions or instructions. For example, in JavaScript, several tokens might be grouped together to form an arithmetic expression like 2 + 3 * 4, which has a specific order of operations based on the priorities of different operators.

Different programming languages have different priorities for their operators, which can affect the way tokens are grouped and evaluated. For example, in JavaScript, the + operator has a lower priority than the * operator, which means that the multiplication is evaluated before the addition.
