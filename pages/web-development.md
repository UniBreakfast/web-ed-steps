# What is Web Development?

It has grown immencely throughout the years. [Web](web.md) development typically focuses on two main areas: frontend and backend. [Frontend](frontend.md) development deals with the user interface and user experience, while [backend](backend.md) development focuses on the server-side logic and data management. Key platforms and tools in web development include:

### Frontend Development

- [Web Browsers](browser.md): Software applications that render and display web content, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
- [HTML](html.md): The markup language used to create the structure and content of webpages.
- [CSS](css.md): A styling language used to control the presentation and layout of webpages.
- [JavaScript (JS)](javascript.md): A programming language that enables developers to create dynamic and interactive web content.

### Backend Development

- [Web Servers](web-servers.md): Software that processes HTTP requests and delivers web content, such as Apache, Nginx, or Express.js.
- [Node.js](nodejs.md): A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be used on the server-side, enabling developers to build full-stack applications with a single language.
- [Databases](database.md): Systems used to store, organize, and manage data, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
