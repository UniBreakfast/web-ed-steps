## What is the Web?

The World Wide Web is an interconnected system of documents, resources, and multimedia that can be accessed through the [internet](internet.md). It was conceived by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in the 1980s as a multitude of interlinked documents - webpages to be accessed using a web browser. Core components of the Web are:

- [URLs](url.md) - Unique addresses that allow to reach a resource.
- [HTML](html.md) - A markup language used to create the structure and content of webpages.
- [HTTP](http.md) - A protocol that governs how browsers and servers communicate and transfer data.
- [Browsers](browser.md) - Software applications that allow users to access and navigate the web by interpreting URLs, HTML, and other web technologies.

Web evolved into a complex ecosystem of interactive applications and services and today incorporates a wide range of technologies:

- [CSS](css.md) - A language of rules used to control the presentation and layout of webpages.
- [JavaScript (JS)](javascript.md): A programming language that enables developers to create dynamic and interactive content.
- [Node.js](nodejs.md) - A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be used on the server-side, enabling developers to build full-stack applications with a single language.
- [Web APIs](api.md) - Sets of rules and protocols that allow developers to interact with various web services and databases.
