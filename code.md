# Code

## What is code?

Code is a text, which is written in a programming language (or markup language). It is used to instruct a computer to perform a task. Code can be written in a [generic text editor](generic-text-editor.md), but there are also [specialized editors](code-editors.md), which are designed to make writing code easier. Code can also be written in a [terminal](terminal.md) or in a [console](console.md) working with a [runtime environment](runtime-environment.md).

## What does code consist of?

Code is made up of individual components known as [tokens](code-tokens.md), which are typically separated from each other by [whitespace](code-whitespace.md). [Specialized code editors](code-editors.md) can help you to write code, by suggesting, autocompleting and recognizing tokens and consistently [highlighting](code-highlighting.md) them. This makes it much easier to read and understand the code.

## How is code processed?

Code is processed by a [runtime environment](runtime-environment.md), which is a program that executes code. The runtime environment can be a [compiler](compiler.md), an [interpreter](interpreter.md), or a [virtual machine](virtual-machine.md). The runtime environment reads the code and executes it. The result of the execution is often a [program](program.md).
